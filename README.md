### 💻 Tech
don't be sendentary uses some open source projects to work properly:

  * [nextJS]
  * [reactjs]
  * [styled-components]
  * [node.js]


### 🔨 Installation

don't be sendentary requires [node.js] to run.

To run this project, you must install all dependecies running the command below inside the repo, then just start the project.

```sh
$ npm install
```
or
```sh
$ yarn
```

after installing all dependecies run this command to start the application:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```
or
```sh

Then don't be sedentary will start in localhost at:
